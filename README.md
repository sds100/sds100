### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

**I'm an Android app developer and a computer science student at Delft University of Technology.**

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Key Mapper](https://github.com/sds100/KeyMapper) which is a FOSS key-mapping app for Android.

ğŸ‘¯ I'm looking for someone to help collaborate on Key Mapper. There are a lot of highly requested features that need implementing and I don't have time to do them all ğŸ˜„.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning... a lot at university.
