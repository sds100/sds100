### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Android app developer and a student at Delft University of Technology. I completed my Computer Science bachelor degree in June 2024 and am now pursuing a master degree in Computer & Embedded Systems Engineering at TU Delft.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Key Mapper](https://github.com/keymapperorg/KeyMapper) which is a FOSS key-mapping app for Android with almost **10 million** downloads. This is one of the most popular apps in its category.
