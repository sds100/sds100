### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer specializing in Android development. I completed my Computer Science bachelor degree in 2024 at Delft University of Technology.

🔭 I’m currently working on [Key Mapper](https://github.com/keymapperorg/KeyMapper) which is a FOSS key-mapping app for Android with over **10 million** downloads.
